# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

The goal of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. We'll also test if there is a link between the paid Amazon Vine program and the results. Our baseline only looked at products with over 20 votes and took the top 50 percent. I am using Amazon's cloud services AWS, Google Colab, and Pyspark to analyze Amazon's reviews for Music.

## Results

Table below which shows a similar of the rating between the Vine and the non Vine campaign.

## Summary

This analysis aims to determine if there is a bias in favor of positive reviews from Vine members. I looked at reviews with more than 20 total votes and those with equal to or greater than 50%. I then selected those that were more likely to be helpful..
